Android = Kotlin and Java

Single code for both platform, these framework can also be considered as native apps (performance equivalent to native applications)
- Xamarin
- Flutter
- React Native

### Web App
Run on top of a device's browser and usually developed in HTML5. Because run within the browser/sandboxed, they usually lack in performance in comparison of native app. The biggest advantage is reduced development and maintenance costs.

### Hybrid App
Executes like a native app, but majority of the process rely on web technologies using embedded web browser (web view). Frameworks:
- Apache Cordova
- Framework 7
- Ionic
- JQuery Mobile
- Native Script
- Onsen UI
- Sencha TOuch

### Progressive Web App (PWA)
